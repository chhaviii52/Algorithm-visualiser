#Algorithm Visualizer#
A visually interactive and educational platform built with React that demonstrates the working of popular algorithms step by step. Ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts who want to understand how algorithms behave under the hood.

#Features#
This project provides graphical representations of various fundamental algorithms in computer science, categorized for easy exploration:

Pathfinding Algorithms
Visualizes how different pathfinding techniques traverse a grid to find the shortest path.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Recursion Tree
Graphically demonstrates how recursive calls are made and resolved. Useful for understanding the call stack and execution flow of recursion-based functions.

Sorting Algorithms
Simple Sorts:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Recursive Sorts:

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Watch how the array changes step-by-step during each phase of sorting.

N-Queens Problem
Visualizes the backtracking approach to placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

Prime Number Visualization
Highlights how numbers are determined to be prime, possibly using trial division or the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Binary Search
Step-by-step visual of binary search on a sorted array — see how the search range shrinks at each step.

Technologies Used
React.js

CSS / Tailwind CSS (if used)

JavaScript (algorithm logic)

React Hooks & Custom Components
